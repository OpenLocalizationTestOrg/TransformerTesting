          <source>The goal of Machine Learning (ML) is to find features to train a model that transforms input data (such as pictures, time series, or audio) to a given output (for example captions, price values, transcriptions).</source>

          <source>In traditional data science, features are often handcrafted.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="103" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>These handcrafted features are fed into a shallow learning algorithm, such as the network shown in the following diagram.</source>

          <source>In Deep Learning (DL), the process of feature extraction is learned through representing inputs as vectors and transforming them, with a series of clever linear algebra operations, into a given output.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="106" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The model output is compared against the expected output using an equation called a loss function.</source>

          <source>The value returned by the loss function of each training input is used to guide the model to extract features that will result in a lower loss value on the next pass.</source>

          <source>After all of this setup, you might find a great model created on another framework and would like to try it out. You donâ€™t want the overhead of getting a new deep learning framework with all of its dependencies set up on your machine.</source>
