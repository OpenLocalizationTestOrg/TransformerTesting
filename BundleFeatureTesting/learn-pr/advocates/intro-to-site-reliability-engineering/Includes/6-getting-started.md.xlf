          <source>There are a number of meetups and conferences that feature SRE content.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="123" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Perhaps the most directly relevant is the globally distributed <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>SREcon conferences<ept id="p1">](https://www.usenix.org/conferences/byname/925)</ept> put on by USENIX (disclaimer: the primary author of this module is one of the cofounders of SREcon).</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="124" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>More and more SRE content is making its way to conferences like <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Velocity<ept id="p1">](https://conferences.oreilly.com/velocity)</ept>, <bpt id="p2">[</bpt>LISA<ept id="p2">](https://www.usenix.org/conferences/byname/5)</ept>, and local DevOps conferences like <bpt id="p3">[</bpt>DevOps Days<ept id="p3">](https://www.devopsdays.org)</ept>.</source>

          <source>If you want to start exploring what it would be like to bring SRE into your environment, it is important to remember that SRE is not an “all or nothing” proposition.</source>

          <source>Mikey Dickerson, a well know SRE from his work at what would become the United States Digital Service (they were responsible for saving healthcare.gov) has proposed a hierarchy of reliability in homage to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="130" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>It is quoted in the <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Practices section<ept id="p1">](https://landing.google.com/sre/book/chapters/part3.html)</ept> of the first SRE book.</source>

          <source>This hierarchy proposes that one must first get monitoring in your environment functional and trustworthy.</source>

          <source>This has to be a first step towards SRE for your environment as well.</source>

          <source>Once you have a monitoring platform you can trust, the next reachable step is to pick a service at work and begin to have SLI and SLO conversations about it.</source>

          <source>Start simple.</source>
