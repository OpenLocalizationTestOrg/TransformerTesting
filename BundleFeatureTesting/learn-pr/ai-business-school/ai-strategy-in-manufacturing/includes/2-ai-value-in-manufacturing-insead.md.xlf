          <source>Watch this video from Peter Zemsky, INSEAD’s Eli Lilly Chaired Professor of Strategy and Innovation, as he explains that while manufacturing has seen much experimentation with proof of concepts, the move to fully scaled AI solutions has been slower than in other sectors.</source>

          <source>The manufacturing and resources industry is a sector where the efficiency AI can bring will have a big impact on value creation given the large capital outlays that are necessary for sophisticated equipment and developing worksites, as well as mineral rights in the case of mining.</source>
