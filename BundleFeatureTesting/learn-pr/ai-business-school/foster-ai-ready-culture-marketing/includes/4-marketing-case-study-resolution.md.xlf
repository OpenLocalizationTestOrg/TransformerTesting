          <source>Our marketing organization’s aim is to be agile and responsive to different markets, collaborate effectively across departments, and be model corporate citizens.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="103" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In particular, our goal is to be a great partner to the sales organization by providing the best leads possible in order to improve conversion rates, accelerate sales cycles, and improve seller efficiency.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="104" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>One of the ways we have done this is by looking for ways to improve lead generation processes through the Global Demand Center, our globally scaled customer acquisition and engagement marketing engine that handles millions of leads per year.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="105" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The Global Demand Center starts the acquisition process by generating leads through events and gated content, such as e-books and whitepapers.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="106" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Leads are placed in personalized engagement programs and then we score them to determine which leads are ready to talk to a seller and which sales channel is appropriate, whether Inside Sales, a partner, or managed account sales.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="107" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Our marketing teams identified several points in this process where AI could have significant impact on marketing effectiveness and outcomes.</source>

          <source>Intelligent lead scoring and qualification assistance</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="109" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>First, we wanted to identify and eliminate leads with fake names or invalid contact information, which accounted for around 12% of the leads we were sending to sales.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="110" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>We saw this as an opportunity to combine the expertise of our employees with AI tools.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="111" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>We built a system to identify such leads based on rules created by our employees and then augmented it with machine learning, which is ideal for capturing various types of keyboard gibberish.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="112" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Machine learning trains our model and, as new data enters the model, the algorithm accurately predicts which leads are fake—saving our sellers valuable time and reducing frustration.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="113" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Next, we implemented machine learning–driven lead scoring.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="114" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Marketing employees partnered with a team of data scientists to create machine learning models that weigh thousands of variables to score our leads.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="115" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This initiative brought together our marketing employees’ knowledge on lead quality and the desired business outcomes with the machine learning expertise of our data scientists.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="116" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The lead score helps us predict the probability that a lead will convert with any given sales channel so we can send the lead to the channel with the best probability.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="117" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This not only helps us increase our conversion rates, it also ensures that we are engaging with customers in the way that serves them best based on their needs.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="118" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Leads are then rescored in real time after every new activity, and there are multiple models, optimized for different geographies and products.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="119" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Importantly, the models are self-learning, adjusting for changing conditions.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="120" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Since a lead score is just a prediction of the customer’s likelihood to convert, we wanted to find a way to confirm each customer’s interest to ensure that we send only the best possible leads to sales.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="121" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>We created an AI-based lead qualification assistant that emails customers to determine interest.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="122" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>When the customer responds, the assistant uses natural language processing to understand the customer’s intent, classifying leads as "interested", "not interested", or "hot".</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="123" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The assistant even understands when the customer actually needs support help and classifies the lead accordingly.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="124" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The assistant is very valuable in identifying what we call “diamonds in the rough,” leads that we deemed low propensity but express interest to buy, and “fool’s gold,” leads that were scored as hot but were found to be uninterested.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="125" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The lead qualification assistant has also been implemented after a marketing-qualified lead has expired.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="126" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The assistant emails the lead again to reevaluate interest, preventing interested customers from falling through the cracks.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="127" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Earlier this year, after the assistant reached out to an expired lead, the customer expressed interest, leading to a $250,000 sale.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="128" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Following qualification, marketing hands off the lead to the appropriate sales channel with the entire email conversation, which provides valuable context.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="129" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For instance, if the customer expressed interest in getting more technical details in their response to the bot, the seller can bring a technical specialist to their very first conversation, accelerating the sales cycle.</source>

        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="132" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>We have also incorporated AI into our account-based marketing sales motion.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="133" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>First, we create a list of targeted accounts for a given service or sales play based on criteria such as company attributes, lead job titles, past purchases, and other signals.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="134" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Then, we do demand generation using paid media, webinars, and other content to drive leads to the Global Demand Center.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="135" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Next, we use AI-based account scoring models to detect marketing surges on an account based on type of engagement and recency of engagement.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="136" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Accounts and leads within those accounts are stack-ranked by this score and the accounts deemed likely to buy are surfaced to sellers.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="137" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Because this is an entirely new sales motion for us, it was important that we seamlessly embed it into the processes and applications currently used by our sellers.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="138" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>To that end, the account-based marketing recommendations are integrated into an AI-based guided selling application called the Daily Recommender.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="139" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The Daily Recommender enables sellers to drill into the individual leads for the account and access custom sales enablement materials that they can use at every step in the sale, from seller-facing preparation content to personalized email templates to pitch decks.</source>

        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="141" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>With these applications of AI in our marketing function, we are making great headway on our mission to be a better partner to sales and provide the best leads possible.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="142" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Using AI to eliminate fake leads, we decreased the number of non-workable leads sent to sales by two-thirds.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="143" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>What’s more, the rate of conversion of marketing-qualified leads to sales-qualified opportunities more than doubled, increasing 108% year over year.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="144" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Combined with accelerated sales cycles, this contributed to improved seller efficiency and ultimately an increase in the sales quota to reflect the greater scale that sellers can now achieve.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="145" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>But this initiative wouldn’t have been successful without cultural changes.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="146" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>When implementing the lead scoring platform, we needed to ensure that it was trusted and adopted by both the marketing and sales teams as a single source of truth on lead quality.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="147" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The teams can now have robust discussions of their objectives using shared data, so conversations are less driven by human bias and rule-of-thumb strategies.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="148" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For instance, marketing can say, “we can give you two thousand more leads with a 2% drop in conversion rate, or we can give you seven hundred more leads with only a 1% drop.”</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="149" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This enables marketing and sales to align on strategic decisions and ultimately be more effective.</source>

          <source>Future steps in AI adoption</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="151" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Our marketing team’s journey with AI is not over; we will continue to evolve our business processes over the coming months and years.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="152" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>First, our marketers are trying to improve the customer journey with machine learning–enabled hyperpersonalization.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="153" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>By using AI models to predict what content customers need most at any given point in their journey, we can create a more dynamic, tailored customer experience.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="154" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Next, we want to be a better partner to the sales and support organizations by expanding the capabilities of the lead qualification assistant.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="155" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>We want to enable the assistant to do triage (e.g. routing customers to support, if that’s what they need), to go further into qualification of leads, and to take care of administrative tasks like scheduling to make the handoff to sales as efficient and frictionless as possible.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="156" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Finally, we would like to expand our ability to predict the lifetime value of each lead, enabling sellers to better prioritize and prepare for sales conversations.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="157" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>These are just some of the ways we’re looking at expanding our use of AI in marketing—we’ll continue to experiment with how AI can help transform our processes and solve business problems.</source>

          <source>Our journey to transforming marketing with AI has included bumps in the road.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="160" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In particular, we learned the importance of ensuring both that AI is working from accurate data and that it is making the right inferences from that data.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="161" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>These are a few lessons from our experience that you can consider on your own journey with AI:</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="162" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Prepare your data before implementing AI and adjust your data practices over time</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="163" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>We found that it’s important to ensure that data is clean and that there are processes to keep it clean before getting started with AI implementation.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="164" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>That said, organizations should acknowledge that they are likely to overlook things in their data preparation and that they will need to adjust data practices over time to keep AI applications functioning optimally.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="165" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>When we started building out our lead scoring platform in marketing, despite everything we did to prepare our data, our models were giving us nonsensical results.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="166" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>From looking at our CRM, we discovered that this was because our sellers were entering inaccurate data for why they were disqualifying leads.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="167" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>We had to partner with sales to train the sellers to provide accurate data to ensure our models could function properly.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="168" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Monitor how AI is learning and adapting to mitigate unintended consequences</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="169" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>By definition, AI will adapt and change over time.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="170" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>We have found that it’s important to monitor AI solutions to ensure they are not making and learning from counterproductive inferences.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="171" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For example, our lead scoring tool was consistently ranking leads from a particular online sales contact form as a low priority.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="172" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Investigating further, we found that this was actually because customers were often misusing the form to ask for support help, meaning that it yielded relatively few sales.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="173" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The AI solution learned from this trend and deprioritized all leads from this source accordingly—leaving some interested customers to slip through the cracks if seller capacity was stretched thin.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="174" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>By monitoring the trends we were seeing in the AI solution, we were able to identify an opportunity to improve our process and better serve customers.</source>

          <source>While the lead scoring models fell under the jurisdiction of our marketing department, it was our sellers who were providing the data that fed into the models, so collaboration with the sales organization was key.</source>
