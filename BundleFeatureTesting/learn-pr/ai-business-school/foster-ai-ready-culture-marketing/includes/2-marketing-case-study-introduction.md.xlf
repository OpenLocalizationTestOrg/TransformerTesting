          <source>Marketing faces unique challenges in today’s business environment.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="103" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>While marketers are exceling in generating leads (a key performance indicator), conversion of leads to sales remains low.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="104" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Only about 28% of businesses are satisfied with their conversion rate,<bpt id="p1">&lt;sup&gt;</bpt>1<ept id="p1">&lt;/sup&gt;</ept> and 42% of B2B professionals identify converting leads into customers as their biggest lead generation challenge.<bpt id="p2">&lt;sup&gt;</bpt>2<ept id="p2">&lt;/sup&gt;</ept></source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="105" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In part, this may be because sellers today have low confidence in marketing leads, which makes them less likely to act on them: a survey by CEB showed that sellers are only 45% likely to pursue a lead referred by a marketing demand generation program.<bpt id="p1">&lt;sup&gt;</bpt>3<ept id="p1">&lt;/sup&gt;</ept> Low confidence is typically driven by past experience with marketing leads.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="106" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>If a seller has had multiple experiences where they’ve contacted a marketing-qualified lead only to discover that the contact information was fake or the lead had no interest, that seller will be reticent to continue pursuing unproductive marketing leads.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="107" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>It’s no surprise then that lack of alignment between sales and marketing is widespread.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="108" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Only 46% of organizations say that their sales and marketing functions are aligned.<bpt id="p1">&lt;sup&gt;</bpt>4<ept id="p1">&lt;/sup&gt;</ept> And the challenges that prevent alignment are telling: 43% of B2B professionals cite lack of accurate/shared data on target accounts and prospects as their biggest challenge in aligning marketing and sales.<bpt id="p2">&lt;sup&gt;</bpt>4<ept id="p2">&lt;/sup&gt;</ept> Clearly, creating a source of accurate, nuanced data on lead quality that both sales and marketing can trust is key to driving alignment and ultimately increasing conversion and revenue.</source>

          <source>At Microsoft we face many of these same challenges.</source>

          <source>Although our engagement programs were surfacing plenty of leads, our conversion to sales remained on par with industry benchmarks and we felt that we could do better.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="112" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Our marketing teams were looking for ways to make better use of our data in identifying and qualifying leads so that we could filter and prioritize them before they are sent to sales to reduce the amount of time sellers spend contacting unproductive leads.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="113" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">

          <source>In short, we face the same challenges as any other marketing organization and we’ve found that we can address many of them with strategic implementation of AI.</source>
