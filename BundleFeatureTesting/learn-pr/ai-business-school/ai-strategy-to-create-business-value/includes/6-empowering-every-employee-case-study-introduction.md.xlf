          <source>Publicis Groupe is facing new and strong competition as its industry evolves and requires new skills.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="103" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Radical and innovative solutions are required to stay ahead of the curve and attract both clients and new talent.</source>

          <source>Founded in 1926, the venerable advertising, media, and consulting network – one of the world’s largest – found that their existing processes kept technology, information, and personnel structured in silos, which made it more difficult to execute projects quickly, provide value to customers, and keep ahead of competitors.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="105" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Their recently appointed Chairman and CEO, Arthur Sadoun, proposed a remarkable strategic evolution: using a platform powered by AI to “break the silos,” and connect every Publicis Groupe employee to teams and tech where they could provide the most value.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="106" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>To do this, they created a platform called Marcel, named after Publicis founder Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet, which uses AI to structure Publicis Groupe’s vast treasure-trove of institutional knowledge and make it available, useful, and relevant to every employee.</source>

          <source>Industry context</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="108" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Publicis Groupe is one of the “Big Four” multinational advertising and public relations agencies.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="109" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Publicis is a global leader in marketing, communications, and digital transformation, and its network contains some of the best-known names in communications and media, including Leo Burnett Worldwide, Publicis Worldwide, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, Zenith, Starcom, and more recently Sapient in the consulting space.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="110" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>With over 80,000 employees spanning 200 specialties over 130 countries, thousands of clients, and an almost hundred-year history, Publicis Groupe is one of the largest and oldest companies of its type in the world.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="111" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Age brings challenges as well as experience.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="112" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In recent years, the agency model has stagnated.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="113" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Established agencies have struggled to offer satisfying solutions to their clients in the face of massive technological change, the mass adoption of online advertising, and small, nimble competitors.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="114" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Agencies face the same problem as many old-media companies: diminishing income and relevance.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="115" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Advertisers have flocked to convenient, highly targeted, and quantifiable online advertising models offered by companies like Google and Facebook.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="116" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>These search and social media platforms are accessible, fast, and often target customers through data analytics and AI.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="117" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Agencies, on the other hand, have high overhead costs and a far higher price point.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="118" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>“This is a race.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="119" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>It’s a race to be relevant,” Publicis CEO Arthur Sadoun told the Financial Times in June 2017.</source>

          <source>“The big difference between today and yesterday is speed.</source>

          <source>You need to be much faster on the execution.”</source>

          <source>Challenge</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="124" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Despite competition from new market players, agencies retain huge value in that they have the institutional knowledge and resources to create engaging, emotive, and meaningful campaigns that can make a huge difference to public perception of a brand or product at scale.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="125" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>But here another problem presents itself, which is especially present in older agencies like Publicis Groupe: silos.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="126" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In pre-digital days, silos were present out of organizational necessity.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="127" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The informational hierarchy created by silos meant the knowledge they contained could be given order and structure.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="128" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Today, thanks to digital disruption and the hugely increased speed of information, silos hamper growth and communication instead.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="129" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>What’s more, as siloed companies have digitized, the data and institutional knowledge they contain has typically become more fragmented and disorganized.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="130" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For Publicis Groupe, which owns multiple different agencies, each with their own divisions and internal knowledge silos, this meant that knowledge was frequently inaccessible, lost, or duplicative.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="131" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Despite the huge expertise of the company as a whole, its individual agencies lacked access to the full resources and best thinking of the company.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="132" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>When Arthur Sadoun took charge of Publicis, becoming its third leader ever over 91 years of existence, he had one objective in mind: making it possible to execute projects more quickly than ever by breaking down the company’s knowledge and personnel silos and creating an environment where everyone had immediate access to the information they needed.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="133" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>But with over 80,000 employees in dozens of different organizations spanning over 100 countries, this was much easier said than done.</source>

          <source>Strategy questions</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="135" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>What are Publicis’ unique strengths and capabilities that a solution should leverage?</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="136" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For businesses to be efficient, they need stakeholders to have access to the right information, at the right time.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="137" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In a world drowning in data, how should Publicis approach providing its wealth of information to employees, without generating more surplus data and information?</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="138" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The five characteristics of high-quality information are: that it is accurate, complete, consistent, unique, and timely.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="139" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>How should Publicis ensure the information they provide employees meets this standard?</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="140" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>When a project needs fresh advice, experience, or technical know-how, how can employees in a large organization find the right colleague to help?</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="141" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Strategically, how should this be approached so that the well-meaning (but ultimately damaging) habits of some managers to keep their groups exclusive and inward-looking is bypassed?</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="142" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>How could Publicis ensure a high probability of internal uptake of a solution?</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="143" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>How could this be measured?</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="144" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Now that you’ve gained context on the challenges Publicis faces today and considered critical questions to answer before implementing AI, let’s look at how Publicis transformed its own organization with AI.</source>
