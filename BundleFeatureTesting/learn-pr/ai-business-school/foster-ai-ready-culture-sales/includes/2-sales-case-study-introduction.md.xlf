          <source>Context</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="102" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Sales organizations have more tools and customer information at their fingertips than ever, but they struggle to make this data accessible and turn it into actionable insights.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="103" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The challenge is to use this data to understand customer behavior so that each seller can deliver the right message to the right customer at the right time—at scale.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="104" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>People involved in decisions</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="105" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In addition, sales organizations are struggling to adapt to the changing sales journey.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="106" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For instance, there are now more decision-makers and influencers involved in a typical sale.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="107" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>CEB has found that there are now an average of 6.8 people involved in each B2B purchase decision up from 5.2 in its previous research.<bpt id="p1">&lt;sup&gt;</bpt>1<ept id="p1">&lt;/sup&gt;</ept> Moreover, decision-makers and influencers are more informed and prefer to do their own research before they engage with a sales representative.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="108" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>With so many stakeholders in play, each more informed than ever before, it’s essential that sellers identify the most engaged contacts and key influencers on an account and know exactly what matters to them.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="109" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Microsoft context: Sales enablement</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="110" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>At Microsoft, these challenges are compounded by a number of factors, not least of which is our transformation from a company that sells licenses and products to one that sells services.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="111" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>With this transformation, our sales processes and competitor landscape have changed dramatically.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="112" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The cloud is one of our most competitive areas and one where we are seeing significant pressure to grow through both net-new and increased consumption.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="113" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Our sellers are making more calls than they used to, which means they’re spending a lot more time preparing for calls with research and analytics and ensuring data hygiene.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="114" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In addition, our sellers deal with a much larger suite of services compared to other companies, even other enterprise leaders.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="115" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>With so many services available to pitch to customers, there is a tremendous need for automated recommendations to ensure that sellers are promoting the right services.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="116" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Moreover, customers come prepared with plenty of research before making a technology stack decision and often don’t engage with a seller until they are close to 60% of the way through their buying journey.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="117" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This means sellers need to have the right technical understanding of each service so that they’re prepared to establish their relevance by having in-depth conversations from day one.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="118" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Supporting sellers with robust learning and readiness content is a challenge.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="119" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Finally, we identified that we were missing an opportunity to implement centralized governance around lead targeting criteria and thereby align our sellers around a single source of white space that can be quality controlled, governed, and continuously measured.</source>
