        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="102" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>We knew that AI could help our sellers generate new business pipeline, pitch the right services at the right time, and streamline their call preparation so they could spend more time bringing value to our customers.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="103" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>But we also knew that we would need to address challenges within our sales culture and habits to sustain the long-term benefits.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="104" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>We implemented an AI-based guided selling application, the Daily Recommender, which provides sellers with data-driven insights and actionable product recommendations to help attain quota, resulting in higher conversion rates and increased seller productivity.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="105" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Daily Recommender harnesses our data to predict the likelihood for a customer to buy products, consume services, and churn.</source>

          <source>Recommendations based on the AI predictions are then curated and presented to sellers in a contextually relevant manner, connected to our sales plays, processes, and strategies.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="107" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Sellers can take action on recommendations within the app (actions include accept and make a call, snooze, and delete)—each action feeds into a supervised learning process that enables the AI to improve over time.</source>

          <source>Daily Recommender helps sellers become more targeted, increasing the conversion rate.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="109" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>It also reduces seller preparation and analysis time and facilitates consistency across the salesforce by providing seller-facing call preparation content and readymade customer-facing content, including case studies and email templates.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="110" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>To realize the full benefits of AI, we needed to ensure that the Daily Recommender would be adopted by our full salesforce, a diverse group of sellers who were reluctant to depart from their existing sales tools and methods.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="111" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>With this in mind, we executed an enterprise-grade enablement strategy that focused on sustained behavioral change rather than short-term training.</source>

        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="124" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The results have been impressive: sellers have reviewed over 40,000 recommendations and we’ve seen a 4x improvement in recommendation success, raising the recommendation-to-opportunity rate to 40%.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="125" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This means that for every five recommendations a seller acts on, two will become serious opportunities for a sale.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="126" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This is significantly higher than the rate we saw with historical business rule–based targeting recommendations, which had a yield of about one in ten.</source>

          <source>In addition, the Daily Recommender has accelerated the sales cycle.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="128" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Because sellers have more relevant discussions with the customers from day one, discovery efforts are accelerated.</source>

          <source>Our journey to transforming sales with AI has included bumps in the road.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="134" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In particular, we learned that buy-in from leadership is essential from day one and that in considering AI use cases organizations should find balance between what could drive the most value for their organization with what is feasible given their organization’s level of AI maturity.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="135" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>These are a few lessons that we learned that you can consider on your own journey with AI:</source>

          <source>Establish an end-to-end AI strategy supported by leadership and first-line managers</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="137" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>To enable true transformation with AI, we’ve found that is not enough to implement technology and wait for transformation to occur.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="138" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>AI transformation won’t happen on an individual basis; it needs to be part of a broader cultural shift.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="139" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>And both leadership and first-line managers need to drive that shift.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="140" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In our own transformation, we found that the tone at the top was paramount to enabling transformation—our leaders needed to be invested and passionate.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="141" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Executive sponsors should not just sign off on AI initiatives, but drive them forward, ensure they’re funded, keep them on track, and demonstrate their passion for achieving the outcome.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="142" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>That said, first-line manager buy-in is just as essential.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="143" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Particularly in sales, where we needed to roll out new processes to a global salesforce, first-line managers were key to ensure adoption and change the culture at the day-to-day level.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="144" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Focus on where AI can drive the most value</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="145" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>We could have started with dozens of separate AI initiatives, but we chose to start with only the ones that we knew would have a strategic impact.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="146" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For example, in sales, we focused our energy on creating a robust Daily Recommender system, because we knew that augmenting the skills of our sellers would have the greatest impact.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="147" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>With all the pressure on enterprises to invest in AI, it’s easy to get caught up in the flurry of possibilities and spread resources too thin by investing in too many applications at once.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="148" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Organizations should take a more strategic and holistic approach to AI by considering how AI can address the biggest risks, challenges, and opportunities in their organizations.</source>

        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="151" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>We believe that for most companies it makes sense to start with low- to no- customization AI solutions, like SaaS applications that are enriched with AI.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="152" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Then, if a company discovers that it has unique data and needs that can’t be met by a SaaS application, it can use AI “accelerators,” tools that facilitate faster and easier AI development.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="153" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Finally, when companies truly need to create custom AI models to unlock deep AI capabilities, they can develop fully custom AI using platforms like Azure AI Platform.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="154" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Our journey to applying AI in sales followed this framework closely.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="155" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>First, we adopted SaaS solutions from Dynamics 365, and while these largely met our needs, we needed to make a few customizations to meet our specific requirements.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="156" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>We recommend taking full advantage of existing SaaS applications and considering your organization’s AI maturity and the prerequisites of your desired AI use cases before pursuing a more custom solution.</source>
