          <source>Retail today is undergoing massive disruption.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="103" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Based on shifting demographics and the rise of online-first retailers, customer expectations and behaviors are changing rapidly.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="104" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Today, customers are shopping across many channels—in fact, 73% of shoppers report using multiple channels during their shopping journey.<bpt id="p1">&lt;sup&gt;</bpt>1<ept id="p1">&lt;/sup&gt;</ept></source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="105" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The emergence of multi-channel retailing has created new challenges for retailers.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="106" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>As customers shop across more channels, they expect their preferences to translate into deeply personalized and consistent experiences whether they’re in store, in browser, or in app.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="107" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Retailers understand this expectation, but struggle to ensure, for instance, that the offers and messaging a customer sees in their email are both personalized and consistent with what they see in-store and on the retailer’s website.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="108" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Making this expectation a reality represents a major opportunity for retailers: 44% of consumers say they would become repeat buyers after personalized experiences, but only 22% of consumers actually find their retail shopping experience to be highly personalized.<bpt id="p1">&lt;sup&gt;</bpt>2<ept id="p1">&lt;/sup&gt;</ept></source>

          <source>Multi-channel retail also presents challenges for retail operations.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="110" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Many retailers lack visibility into inventory levels across channels, and supply chain and fulfillment are increasingly complex to manage.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="111" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This means, for instance, that many retailers are not able to reliably prevent loss of business from out-of-stock products: 70% of retailers desire the ability to accurately forecast future out-of-stocks but cannot do so today.<bpt id="p1">&lt;sup&gt;</bpt>3<ept id="p1">&lt;/sup&gt;</ept></source>

        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="115" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>One of Microsoft Store’s challenges around multi-channel retail has been an influx of data, particularly customer feedback.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="116" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This feedback is coming from many different sources (from online ratings and reviews to post-purchase surveys and in-store interactions), making it challenging for us to glean insights.</source>
