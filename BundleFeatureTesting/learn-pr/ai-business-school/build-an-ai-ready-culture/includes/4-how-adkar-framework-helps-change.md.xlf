          <source>This is, without a doubt, one of the hardest things for people to do.</source>

          <source>Change management techniques are most helpful when they use a framework that guides the organization in a structured manner.</source>

          <source>Before getting into Prosci's framework, we would like to highlight some ideas that are key in every change process, and that provide a useful context to understand the pillars of Prosci’s model.</source>

          <source><bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Senders and receivers:<ept id="p1">**</ept> It’s important to keep in mind that every communication has a sender and a receiver, so what one person says may not mean what the other hears or understands.</source>

          <source>In addition, the identity of the sender can influence how the message is received.</source>

          <source>Executive sponsorship provides resources and funding, establishes priorities, and understands and communicates why the change is being made.</source>

          <source>It also provides consistent support and the proper channel for resistance management.</source>

          <source>Leadership, at all levels, once more proves crucial.</source>

        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="138" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>These milestones are sequential because people need to fully understand, commit, and achieve one milestone before they can effectively tackle the next one.</source>
