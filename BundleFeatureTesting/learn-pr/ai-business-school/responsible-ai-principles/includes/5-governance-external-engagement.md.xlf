        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="112" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>As discussed in the previous unit, the first step for any AI governance system is to establish guiding ethical principles for the organization.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="113" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This is especially important because laws and regulations around ethics and technology are relatively nascent.</source>

          <source>With guiding principles providing a foundation, governance systems are generally tasked with objectives that include developing and implementing policies, standards, and best practices, building a culture of integrity, providing advice, and educating employees.</source>

          <source>To help your organization get started, we have provided an overview of three common governance approaches below: hiring a Chief Ethics Officer, establishing an ethics office, and forming an ethics committee.</source>

          <source>For any type of governance system to be successful, it must report to the board of directors and have the financial and human resources, authority, and processes to affect real change throughout the organization.</source>

        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="121" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Often organizations choose to consolidate their ethics initiatives under a Chief Ethics Officer.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="122" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>While often coupled with legal compliance, the Chief Ethics Officer’s role covers all aspects of remaining ethical and responsible.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="123" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>With the advantage of centralized decision-making, this form of governance enables companies to quickly develop policies around ethics while ensuring there is accountability for each decision.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="124" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Hiring this public-facing role can also be a good way can showcase a company’s commitment to engage with AI and other technology in a responsible and trustworthy manner.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="125" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>However, while the Chief Ethics Officer role can very effectively create policies, as an individual without a team they may struggle to implement them across an organization without the support of an ethics office.</source>

          <source>The second governance approach focuses on empowering employees across the organization.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="128" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>It involves forming a dedicated ethics team from different levels of the company that is solely focused on ensuring the ethical principles are being followed by all employees.</source>

          <source>Depending on your organization, the ethics office can be independent or part of a broader risk, compliance, or legal team.</source>

          <source>Establishing policies around how AI is deployed, used, and maintained – and training employees on how to follow those policies – can help ensure alignment with your internal AI principles and protect employees and customers from unintended consequences.</source>

          <source>If you are developing AI in-house, we also recommend that your ethical governance system provides your developers with detailed and thorough standard guidance that can help them design and develop AI solutions to reflect your organization’s ethical principles.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="160" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Because AI systems vary widely in terms of purpose and operation, you might find it necessary to also create guidelines for specific AI technologies.</source>

        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="167" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Along with these guidelines, your ethical governance system should take advantage of tools and resources that make it easier for developers to spot and design against potentially harmful issues like biases, safety and privacy gaps, and exclusionary practices.</source>
