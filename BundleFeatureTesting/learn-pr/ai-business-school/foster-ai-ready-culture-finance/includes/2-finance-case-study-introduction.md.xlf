          <source>Microsoft’s finance organization was looking for ways to intelligently automate processes and empower employees to deliver more forward-looking insights and forecasts.</source>

          <source>Context</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="107" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The finance organization is at the heart of any business and plays a key role in maintaining fiscal responsibility and controlling vital functions such as budgeting and compliance.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="108" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>It’s essential that businesses keep finance top of mind when reconsidering business processes.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="109" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Today, finance organizations face challenges in a number of key areas.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="110" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The first is the scale and growth of data.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="111" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>According to EY, “many finance teams are simply overwhelmed by the volume and variety” of their data: 49% of finance leaders say they spend more time gathering and processing data than they do analyzing it.<bpt id="p1">&lt;sup&gt;</bpt>1<ept id="p1">&lt;/sup&gt;</ept> Meanwhile, the majority of financial analysts continue to use Excel as their primary tool, but growth of data is pushing Excel to its limits.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="112" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Finance organizations need to augment Excel with intelligent tools that enable them to get the most from their data.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="113" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Second, finance organizations are struggling to become more forward-looking.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="114" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Finance has traditionally been conceived as a backward-looking function that deals largely with reporting the past.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="115" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>To become a better partner to the rest of the business, finance needs to offer forward-looking insights and projections, but many companies lack the tools to do this easily.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="116" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Third, finance organizations are dependent on manual, repetitive processes, which create opportunities for human error.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="117" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>These include journal entries, close processes, and reporting—crucial activities that require too much human capital today.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="118" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>There are huge opportunities in these areas to automate processes intelligently and ultimately increase accuracy, efficiency, and transparency.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="119" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Fourth, traditional risk management techniques are no longer adequate to address growing business complexity, new regulations, and increased financial and cybersecurity risk.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="120" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For example, reliance on sampling techniques for internal controls and audits opens the door for potentially risky transactions to fall through the cracks.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="121" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Because risk management is a foundational responsibility, organizations need to find strategies to mitigate risks and create more transparency in their processes.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="122" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Microsoft’s context: Finance operations</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="123" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For Microsoft, these challenges are compounded by dramatic growth and change.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="124" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Over the past decade, we have nearly doubled our revenue and quintupled our stock price, while making major changes to our business model.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="125" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>As our revenue grows and our business becomes ever more complex, the challenge for our finance organization has been to serve the company without increasing the number of finance personnel.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="126" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This has only been possible thanks to technology and cultural shifts.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="127" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This follows a trend that analysts are seeing across organizations.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="128" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>According to Accenture, personnel in finance functions like compliance are staying flat, prompting Accenture to advise that finance organizations "can no longer rely on adding headcount to increase effectiveness."<bpt id="p1">&lt;sup&gt;</bpt>2<ept id="p1">&lt;/sup&gt;</ept></source>
