          <source>Now let’s take a look at how knowledge mining works, and how it was applied by iCertis, a contract management company, to draw valuable insights from a large amount of unstructured data.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="116" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>As you saw in the video, Azure Cognitive Search ingested data in the form of PDFs into Azure Blob Storage.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="117" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Then, with key phrase extraction and named entity recognition, language detection, and automatic translation, cognitive services enriched the data and created a custom General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) risk model.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="118" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>When connected to Azure web apps, this created a searchable experience than enabled two million users to manage more than five million contracts.</source>

          <source>Here is a diagram of the knowledge mining process similar to that used by iCertis, that illustrates how content is ingested, cracked, enriched, and indexed to allow for data mining and search through various applications such as websites and chatbots.</source>
