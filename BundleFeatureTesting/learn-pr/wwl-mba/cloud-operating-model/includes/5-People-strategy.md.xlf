          <source>A migration journey to the cloud is a strategic decision, one that requires engaging senior members of IT and business leaders from around the organization.</source>

          <source>They need to understand all aspects of the cloud to decide which of the many options and approaches to take.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="113" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>One of the most effective ways to begin the journey is to create a <bpt id="p1">*</bpt>Cloud Strategy Team<ept id="p1">*</ept> (CST) consisting of business leaders in finance, IT infrastructure, and application groups, as illustrated in this graphic.</source>

          <source>The CST must lead the cloud analysis and experimentation phase.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="116" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>At the start of the cloud adoption analysis, the CST is responsible for reviewing business requirements and capabilities to identify possible use cases for cloud adoption.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="117" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The CST is also responsible for building or facilitating the creation of architectures and patterns and for providing guidance for deployment of the re-envisioned applications or services.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="118" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">

        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="119" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>One of the key driving functions in creating this team is to promote long-term commitment to the cloud journey.</source>

          <source>The team establishes a practice for continuously evaluating and experimenting to help determine the appropriate platform and destination for each application.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="121" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>One of the first tasks of CST members is to spend time educating themselves, making sure all participants have a similar understanding of cloud technology.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="122" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For better or worse, the technology comes with its own set of acronyms, so learning to speak a common language early accelerates future conversations.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="123" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Team members can also spend time familiarizing themselves with the offerings from platform, tool, and cloud application providers.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="124" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>When the team begins to draft the strategy, members should understand that not all services or applications end up in the public cloud, for various reasons.</source>

          <source>At the start of the migration journey, the organization will use a hybrid cloud.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="126" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This means—at least for some time—certain applications remain on-premises and, for cloud transition, co-existence is required.</source>

          <source>If IT staff is to function as a change agent supporting current and emerging cloud technologies, IT buy-in for the use and integration of these technologies is needed.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="129" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For this, staff members need the following:</source>

          <source>An understanding of their roles and of any changes to their current positions.</source>

        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="133" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The most notable transformations are often marked by changes in staff roles.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="134" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For example, in the age of virtualization, the requirement for individuals working with physical servers diminished and was replaced with a need for virtualization specialists.</source>

          <source>Similarly, as institutions shift to cloud computing, roles will likely change again.</source>

          <source>Datacenter specialists might be replaced with cloud financial analysts.</source>
