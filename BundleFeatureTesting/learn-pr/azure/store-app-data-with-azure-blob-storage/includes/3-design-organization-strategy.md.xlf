          <source>When designing an app that needs to store data, it's important to think about how the app is going to organize data across storage accounts, containers, and blobs.</source>

          <source>Storage accounts</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="103" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>A single storage account is flexible enough to organize your blobs however you like, but you should use additional storage accounts as necessary to logically separate costs and control access to data.</source>

          <source>Containers and blobs</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="105" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The nature of your application and the data that it stores should drive your strategy for naming and organizing containers and blobs.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="106" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Apps using blobs as part of a storage scheme that includes a database often don't need to rely heavily on organization, naming, or metadata to indicate anything about their data.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="107" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Such apps commonly use identifiers like GUIDs as blob names and reference these identifiers in database records.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="108" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The app will use the database to determine where blobs are stored and the kind of data they contain.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="109" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Other apps may use Azure Blob storage more like a personal file system, where container and blob names are used to indicate meaning and structure.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="110" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Blob names in these kinds of apps will often look like traditional file names and include file name extensions like <ph id="ph1">`.jpg`</ph> to indicate what kind of data they contain.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="111" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>They'll use virtual directories (see below) to organize blobs and will frequently use metadata tags to store information about blobs and containers.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="112" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>There are a few key things to consider when deciding how to organize and store blobs and containers.</source>

          <source>Naming limitations</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="114" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Container and blob names must conform to a set of rules, including length limitations and character restrictions.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="115" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>See the Further Reading section at the end of this module for more specific information about naming rules.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="116" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Public access and containers as security boundaries</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="117" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>By default, all blobs require authentication to access.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="118" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>However, individual containers can be configured to allow public downloading of their blobs without authentication.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="119" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This feature supports many use cases, such as hosting static website assets and sharing files.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="120" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This is because downloading blob contents works the same way as reading any other kind of data over the web: you just point a browser or anything that can make a GET request at the blob URL.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="121" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Enabling public access is important for scalability because data downloaded directly from Blob storage doesn't generate any traffic in your server-side app.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="122" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Even if you don't immediately take advantage of public access or if you will use a database to control data access via your application, plan on using separate containers for data you want to be publicly available.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="123" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Blobs in a container configured for public access can be downloaded without any kind of authentication or auditing by anyone who knows their storage URLs.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="124" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Never put blob data in a public container that you don't intend to share publicly.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="125" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In addition to public access, Azure has a shared access signature feature that allows fine-grained permissions control on containers.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="126" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Precision access control enables scenarios that further improve scalability, so thinking about containers as security boundaries in general is a helpful guideline.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="127" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Blob name prefixes (virtual directories)</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="128" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Technically, containers are "flat" and do not support any kind of nesting or hierarchy.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="129" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>But if you give your blobs hierarchical names that look like file paths (such as <ph id="ph1">`finance/budgets/2017/q1.xls`</ph>), the API's listing operation can filter results to specific prefixes.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="130" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This allows you to navigate the list as if it was a hierarchical system of files and folders.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="131" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This feature is often called <bpt id="p1">*</bpt>virtual directories<ept id="p1">*</ept> because some tools and client libraries use it to visualize and navigate Blob storage as if it was a file system.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="132" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Each folder navigation triggers a separate call to list the blobs in that folder.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="133" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Using names that are like file names for blobs is a common technique for organizing and navigating complex blob data.</source>

          <source>Blob types</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="135" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>There are three different kinds of blobs you can store data in:</source>

          <source><bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Block blobs<ept id="p1">**</ept> are composed of blocks of different sizes that can be uploaded independently and in parallel.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="137" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Writing to a block blob involves uploading data to blocks and committing them to the blob.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="138" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source><bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Append blobs<ept id="p1">**</ept> are specialized block blobs that support only appending new data (not updating or deleting existing data), but they're very efficient at it.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="139" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Append blobs are great for scenarios like storing logs or writing streamed data.</source>

          <source><bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Page blobs<ept id="p1">**</ept> are designed for scenarios that involve random-access reads and writes.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="141" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Page blobs are used to store the virtual hard disk (VHD) files used by Azure Virtual Machines, but they're great for any scenario that involves random access.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="142" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Block blobs are the best choice for most scenarios that don't specifically call for append or page blobs.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="143" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Their block-based structure supports very fast uploads and downloads and efficient access to individual pieces of a blob.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="144" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The process of managing and committing blocks is automatically handled by most client libraries, and some will also handle parallel uploads and downloads to maximize performance.</source>
