          <source>As your workload changes due to a spike or drop in demand, a cloud computing system can compensate by automatically adding or removing resources.</source>

          <source>Since the cloud is elastic, it automatically allocates more computing resources to handle the increased traffic.</source>

          <source>Another example is if you are running an application used by employees, you can have the cloud automatically add resources for the peak operating hours during which most people access the application, and remove the resources at the usual end of the day.</source>
