          <source>If we start on the perimeter of the network, we're focused on limiting and eliminating attacks from the internet.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="126" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>A great first place to start is to assess the resources that are internet-facing, and only allow inbound and outbound communication where necessary.</source>

          <source>Azure Security Center is a great place to look for this information, as it will identify internet-facing resources that don't have network security groups (NSG) associated with them, as well as resources that are not secured behind a firewall.</source>

          <source>The web application firewall feature of the application gateway protects the system from malicious attacks whereas, the load balancer distributes the legitimate requests among virtual machines.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="134" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For protection of non-HTTP-based services or for increased customization, network virtual appliances (NVA) can be used to secure your network resources.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="135" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">

        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="136" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>NVAs can provide greater customization of security for those applications that require it, but can come with increased complexity, so careful consideration of requirements is advised.</source>
