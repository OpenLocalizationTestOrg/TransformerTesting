          <source>Azure Site Recovery is a service that's dedicated to managing process recovery for workloads running on VMs deployed to Azure, VMs running on physical servers, and workloads running directly on physical servers.</source>

          <source>Site Recovery replicates workloads to alternate locations and helps you to failover when an outage occurs and supports testing of a disaster recovery plan.</source>
