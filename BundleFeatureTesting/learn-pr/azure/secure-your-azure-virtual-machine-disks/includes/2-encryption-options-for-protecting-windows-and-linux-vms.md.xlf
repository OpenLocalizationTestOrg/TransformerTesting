          <source>When to use encryption?</source>

          <source>Computer data is at risk when it's in transit (transmitted across the Internet or other network), and when it's at rest (saved to a storage device).</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="152" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">

        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="153" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For example, someone might download the Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) file associated with an Azure VM, and save it on their laptop.</source>

          <source>If the VHD is not encrypted, the contents of the VHD are potentially accessible to anyone who can mount the VHD file on their computer.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="155" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For operating system (OS) disks, data such as passwords are encrypted automatically, so even if the VHD is not itself encrypted, it's not easy for such information to be accessed.</source>

          <source>Applications may also automatically encrypt their own data.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="157" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>However, even with such protections, if someone with malicious intent were to gain access to a data disk, and the disk itself was not encrypted, they might then be in a position to exploit any known weaknesses in that application's data protection.</source>

          <source>Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) makes use of VM operating system tools (BitLocker and DM-Crypt), so the VM itself has to do some work when encryption or decryption on VM disks is being performed.</source>
