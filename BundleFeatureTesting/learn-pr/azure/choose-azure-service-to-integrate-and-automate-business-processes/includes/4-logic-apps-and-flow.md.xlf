          <source>Scenario</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="106" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>On your original campus, you have five bike rental shops.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="107" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Each shop has a list of bikes for hire and its own database that records the bikes and their features and whether they are on hire or in the shop.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="108" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Currently, each bike can only be hired from its home shop.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="109" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>When a customer returns a bike to another shop, your staff move it back to the shop where it is listed on the database.</source>

          <source>You'd like to change the process so that each bike can be hired from any shop.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="111" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>However, you want to ensure staff can find out quickly where each bike is.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="112" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>At the university in the next state, the bike hire business invested in a third party system to track bike locations.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="113" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>When a bike arrives back at a hire shop, a unique barcode on the crossbar is scanned.</source>

          <source>When a bike leaves a shop with a customer, the location is changed to "On Hire" and the customer name is recorded in a separate column.</source>

          <source>This system has proved helpful when a customer asks for a bike with specific frame size and/or specific features, such as an electric motor or all-terrain suspension.</source>

          <source>If a shop doesn't have a bike with the right equipment, the shop can quickly find out where such a bike is and get it or send the customer to the right shop.</source>

          <source>Let's look at the Azure technologies available to implement the business process and integrate with the bike location database:</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="144" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Microsoft Flow</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="145" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">

          <source>Azure Service Apps WebJobs</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="148" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>You could use any of these technologies and others to build a workflow for this business process.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="149" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Each technology can also integrate with any REST API, so you could also use any of these technologies to integrate with the bike location system.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="150" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>How then, can you choose?</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="151" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Design-first or code-first?</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="152" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>We know that your Managing Director and her staff want to understand the workflow and a higher level than examining the code and implementation.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="153" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>She also doesn't like separate documents describing a process, because it so easily becomes out-of-date when the process changes.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="154" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>If you choose a design-first approach, the workflow is visualized in an easy-to-understand design surface.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="155" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In addition, that diagram is not a separate document, but a picture of the process as it is implemented.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="156" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The benefit is that there's no possibility that the diagram is not updated when the process is changed.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="157" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For this reason, choose a design-first approach.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="158" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Microsoft Flow or Azure Logic Apps?</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="159" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Now you must choose from the two design-first technologies:</source>

          <source>Microsoft Flow</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="161" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Azure Logic Apps</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="162" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>There's no suggestion in the scenario that shop staff should be able to modify the business process.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="163" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In addition, to connect to the bike location database through its REST API, you will need to create a custom connector.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="164" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This is a developer task.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="165" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>It seems sensible that the development of the custom connector and the workflow should be done by the same person or team.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="166" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Since these must be developers, it's best to use Azure Logic Apps.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="167" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>As this exercise shows, we can narrow down the technology to use for a given solution by simply understanding the business process and the audience.</source>
