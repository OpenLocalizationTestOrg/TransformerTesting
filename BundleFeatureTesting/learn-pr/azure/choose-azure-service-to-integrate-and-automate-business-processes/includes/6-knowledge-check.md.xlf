          <source>You work for a company that makes TV adverts.</source>

          <source>You want to formalize two business processes:</source>

        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="106" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>A completed advert is put through this editorial process to ensure that it meets the standards of taste, decency, grammar, style, and legal requirements in the jurisdiction where it will be broadcast.</source>

          <source>A completed advert is also put through this process in which  customers, the director, and members of the board of directors, can give feedback.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="109" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The advert review process should be managed by members of the creative team, because it will need to change regularly.</source>

          <source>The creative team would prefer not to have to wait for a developer to become available whenever a change is needed.</source>

          <source>The feedback collection process calls an on-premises SharePoint server.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="112" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Because this server is not as reliable as a cloud-based server would be, developers want to carefully control the way the workflow retries this connection, if there is a failure.</source>
