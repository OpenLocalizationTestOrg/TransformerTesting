          <source>Few organizations have the resources to support permanent deployments of super-powerful compute platforms, which may only occasionally be used to capacity.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="102" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>More typically, you need a flexible and scalable compute solution, such as Azure Batch, to provide the computational power.</source>

        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="113" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>At a high level, Azure Batch involves a number of components working together.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="114" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Everything needs to take place within the context of an Azure Batch account, which acts as a container for all Batch resources.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="115" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For some use cases, you may wish to associate this account with an Azure Storage account for the purposes of downloading input files and applications for use during execution and storing their results.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="116" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Within your Azure Batch account, you can create pools of virtual compute nodes, running either Windows or Linux, of the number and CPU and memory size that you specify, which are managed and scheduled for you by the Azure Batch service.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="117" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>A Batch account can contain many Batch pools.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="118" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Once you've created one or more pools, you create individual jobs, which act like logical containers for all the tasks you schedule and can share common properties.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="119" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Again, it's perfectly possible to have many jobs.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="120" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>And finally, you create tasks, which describe how the work actually gets done.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="121" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>You can either use tasks to directly invoke the command line, or the tasks can run applications that you upload to Azure Storage.</source>

          <source>As shown in the graphic below, a typical real-world Azure Batch scenario will require data and application files.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="126" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The Batch workflow begins by uploading these data and application files to an Azure storage account.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="127" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>You then create a Batch pool with as many Windows or Linux virtual compute nodes as needed.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="128" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>They can also be autoscaled according in case the demands of your workloads vary over time.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="129" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The Batch service will then handle bringing the nodes online and scheduling tasks for execution onto the nodes.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="130" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Before the tasks begin execution, they may download any data and application files from storage that they need for processing.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="131" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>While the tasks are executing, it's possible to query the status of the nodes and the progress of the tasks.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="132" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Once the nodes complete their tasks, their task output can be examined or pushed to Azure storage.</source>
