          <source>How Traffic Manager works</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="107" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>When a client attempts to connect to a service, first it resolves the DNS name of the service as an IP address.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="108" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The client then connects to that IP address to access the service.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="109" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Traffic Manager uses DNS to direct clients to a specific service endpoint IP address based on the rules of the traffic routing method that's used.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="110" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Clients connect directly to the selected endpoint.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="111" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Traffic Manager isn't a proxy or gateway.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="112" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Traffic Manager doesn't see the traffic that passes between the clients and the service; it just gives clients the IP address of where they need to go.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="113" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Traffic Manager routing methods</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="114" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Traffic Manager supports different methods for choosing how traffic is routed to multiple endpoints.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="115" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Traffic Manager applies a traffic routing method to each DNS query it receives and determines which endpoint is returned in the response.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="116" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>You can choose from six traffic routing methods.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="117" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Weighted routing</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="118" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Choose weighted when you want to distribute traffic across a set of endpoints, either evenly or based on different weights.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="119" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The weight is an integer from 1 to 1,000.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="120" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For each DNS query received, Traffic Manager randomly chooses an available endpoint.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="121" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The probability of choosing an endpoint is based on the weights assigned to all available endpoints.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="122" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Example of a setup where a client connects to a Traffic Manager and their traffic is routed based on weightings of three endpoints.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="123" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Performance routing</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="124" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>If you have endpoints in different geographic locations, you can use performance routing to send users to the endpoint that has the best performance for the user.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="125" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>To choose the best endpoint to use, this routing method uses an internet latency table, which actively tracks network latencies to the endpoints from locations around the globe.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="126" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>When a user makes a request, Traffic Manager returns the best performing endpoint based on the location of the request.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="127" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Example of a setup where a client connects to Traffic Manager and their traffic is routed based on relative performance of three endpoints.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="128" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Geographic routing</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="129" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>With the geographic routing method, users are directed to specific endpoints based on where their DNS query originates.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="130" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Using this method allows you to geo-fence content to specific user regions.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="131" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For example, European users can be directed to an endpoint in Europe that has specific terms and conditions for regional compliance.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="132" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Users in China can be directed to an endpoint that has been localized in Mandarin.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="133" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Example of a setup where a client connects to Traffic Manager and their traffic is routed based on the geographic location of four endpoints.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="134" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Multivalue routing</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="135" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>You can use the multivalue routing method to get multiple healthy endpoints in a single DNS query response.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="136" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The caller can make client-side retries with other endpoints if an endpoint is unresponsive.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="137" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This pattern can increase the availability of a service and reduce the latency associated with a new DNS query to obtain a healthy endpoint.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="138" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Subnet routing</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="139" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This method maps the set of user IP address ranges to specific endpoints within a Traffic Manager profile.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="140" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>When a request is received, the endpoint returned will be the one mapped for that request's source IP address.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="141" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For example, using subnet routing, a customer can route all requests from their corporate office to a different endpoint, where they might be testing an internal-only version of the app.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="142" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Another scenario is if you want to provide a different experience to users who connect from a specific ISP (for example, to block users from a specific ISP).</source>

          <source>Priority routing</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="144" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The Traffic Manager profile contains a prioritized list of service endpoints.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="145" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>By default, Traffic Manager sends all traffic to the primary (highest-priority) endpoint.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="146" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>If the primary endpoint isn't available, Traffic Manager routes the traffic to the second endpoint.</source>

          <source>If both the primary and secondary endpoints are not available, the traffic goes to the third endpoint, and so on.</source>
        </trans-unit><trans-unit id="148" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Availability of the endpoint is based on the configured status (enabled or disabled) and the ongoing endpoint monitoring that is set up.</source>
